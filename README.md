#  SML -> Racket ğŸš€ 

Welcome to SML to Racket translator.

## Description

The goal of this project is to implement a compiler which will be able to parse `SML` code, evaluate it's semantics, and as a result produce valid `Racket` code.

## Project summary  

- Tokenization (lexical analysis) of SML code
- Syntax analysis: Abstract Syntax Tree
  - core syntax
- Semantic analysis: type evaluation
  - core semantics
- Code generation: target language ==> Racket

Implementation of the compiler will be based on: http://sml-family.org/sml97-defn.pdf
